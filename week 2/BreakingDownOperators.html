		<h1>Operators</h1>

			// =, +, -: These of Operators
			// Operators
			// Functionality based on the left hand side(LHS) and right hand side (RHS) values/statements
			
			var gasTankInLitres = 200; // The Assignment Operator we use the '=' symbol
									// The LHS Is the variable that is assigned the value specified on the right hand side
			const PI = 3.14159; 
			//PI = 5;
			
			// +, -: Simple Math operators (Addition, Subtraction)
			// Depending on values on LHS and RHS the functionality of symbols such as '+' differ. 
			
			// What are some other operators?
			// Multiplication (*) Note: 5 * 10 not 5 x 10.
			var z = 5 * 7;
			console.log(z);
			
			// Division (/): Note // is not double division, its a comment
			var y = 10 / 2;
			console.log(y);
			
			// Combining use of these mathimatical operations can be done just as you would in traditional math
			// Order of operations still takes presidence in your code
			var x = (5 * 10) + 10;
			console.log(x);
			
			// Pretty Straight forward but it is worth noting
			
			// Modulus (%)
			// Calculate the remainder of a division operation
			var remainder = 12 % 5;
			console.log(remainder);
			
			// Logical Operators
			// Greater-Than (>), Less-Than (<)
			// These symbols return a boolean value based on the LHS and RHS condition for that specified operator
			var ageToSeeMovie = 18;
			var userAge = 10;
			var result1 = (userAge > ageToSeeMovie); // false
			var result2 = (userAge < ageToSeeMovie); // true
			console.log(result1);
			console.log(result2);
			
			// Equals Symbol (==)
			var result3 = (4 == 4);
			console.log(result3);
			
			// Greater-Than Or Equal Operator
			var result4 = 18 >= ageToSeeMovie; // Old enough ?
			console.log(result4);
			// Depending on your brain and how it prefers to approach a problem 
			// you can alter how you might perform a boolean expression, using a combination of logical operators and LHS/RHS values
			/* 
				Both do the same thing and include the 18 year old value in the true/false result
				18 >= 18 
				18 > 17
			*/
			// Less-Than Or Equal Operator
			// NOTE: Spacing is important when writing code in general, and even more important when it comes to writing operators. Inluding the space between something like <= is the difference between functional code and a syntax error
			var result5 = (16 <= 16);
			
			// Not Equal Operator 
			// It returns true if the LHS and RHS are not equal
			var age = 65;
			var result6 = (age != 65);
			console.log(result6);
			
			// There are some silly things that Javascript does/allows
			//var result7 = (4 == 4);
			var result7 = (4 == "4");
			console.log(result7); // True
			
			// Strict '==='
			var result8 = (4 === "4");
			console.log(result8); // False
			
			// Stict not Equal 
			var result9 = (4 != "5");
			console.log(result9);
			
			result9 = (4 !== "5");
			console.log(result9);
			
			// Logical Operators are utilized in boolean expressions
			// Comparison Operators
			// && (AND)   ||  (OR)
			
			userAge = 30;
			userGender = "Female";
		
			// AND (&&) returns TRUE if BOTH the LHS and RHS values are true
			var EligableForInsurance = ( userGender == "Female" && userAge >= 25 );
			console.log(EligableForInsurance);
			
			userAge = 16;
			userGender = "Female";
		
			// OR (||) Returns TRUE as long as one or both of the values on the LHS or RHS are true
			// Returns false when Both LHS and RHS are false
			EligableForInsurance = ( userGender == "Female" || userAge >= 25 );
			console.log(EligableForInsurance);
			
			// A Boolean
			var skyIsBlue = true;
			
			
			/* In Summary: 
				-The operators all behave using Left Hand Side and Right Hand Side association. 
				-Depending on datatypes on either side, results may differ. 
				-You can combine operators to perform based on how YOU inturpret a solution to a problem.
				-These are all tools for you to use when solving problems. 
				-Often there is no "one" way to approach a problem, so long as the logic results the way you intend
